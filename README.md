# MDI220 Statistics Project: Daily Electric Power Consumption in France

This project analyzes the daily electric power consumption in France from 2013 to 2023, focusing on statistical modeling, parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.

## Topics Covered

1. **Parameter Estimation:**
    - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution.
    - Demonstrating unbiasedness of estimators.
    - Applying MLE to real-world data (daily power consumption).

2. **Goodness of Fit:**
    - Assessing the suitability of the Gaussian model using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
    - Quantifying the dissimilarity between real data and the Gaussian model using a custom metric.
    - Comparing the model fit for different regions and seasons.

3. **Bayesian Statistics:**
    - Incorporating prior knowledge using a Gaussian prior distribution for the mean.
    - Deriving the posterior distribution for the mean.
    - Comparing Bayesian estimates with MLE estimates.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
    - Testing hypotheses about the standard deviation and mean using statistical tests.
    - Applying Chi-squared test for variance and Student's t-test for mean.
    - Interpreting test results and drawing conclusions.

5. **Testing Independence:**
    - Investigating the independence of power consumption between two regions.
    - Visualizing the joint distribution using Seaborn.
    - Applying a Chi-squared test for independence.

6. **Confidence Intervals:**
    - Constructing confidence intervals for the mean power consumption.
    - Interpreting confidence intervals and their implications.
